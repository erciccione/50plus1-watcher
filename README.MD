## This is my first program ever!
It's for educational purpose. I did it to practice with Ruby and APIs, but i want to keep develop it until it reach a decent quality.

### Dependencies
I added some fancy coloration, so the script needs the gem 'term/ansicolor'
to install it digit `gem install term-ansicolor`

### Fire it up!
If Ruby is installed you can open the program typing `ruby 50plus1.rb`, if not run it as a normal script: `./50plus1.rb`

If you have any suggestions/criticism/improvements please open a ticket or make a Pull Request, i would really appreciate it.
